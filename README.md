# hello-world
Just started using github and this is, of course, the first thing i create

Adding a bit of stuff here to learn using the branch and commit featurs of GitHub 
and stuff and things.

And now i'm finally geting around to learning how to use git locally and interact
with github.. so this little addition to this file is the result of .. yadda yadda..
:-)

oops.. forgot to do my 'git config user.name' and 'git config user.email' on that
first change.

All of the above is the ramblings of a madman!

This project is to become the most advanced and powerful version of 'Hello World'
ever created!

Now if I could just get around to adding some files with code.. hmm.
