# hello-world

This project is to become the most advanced and powerful version of 'Hello World'
ever created!

Ok, so I have moved on beyond the simple 'Hello World' and added a bit of flavor by 
allowing for some random synonyms of 'hello' and 'world' to be chosen as the message
to be displayed.

It will will display this message in a Kivy app in a gui window.  

Future additions: 
    After much study and hair pulling trial and error I suppose,
    1. A button to let you get a new greeting rather than closing the window are running
       the program over and over. (cause that just got boring quick.)
    2. Jeez man!  Lemme get 1. out of the way first!
